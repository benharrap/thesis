Since the colonisation of Australia in the late 1700s, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been subject to many forms of colonial violence, one of which was the systematic removal of their children. These assimilationist policies of removals aimed to disconnect children from their culture and Country and continued through to the 1970s when the policy that created the Stolen Generations ended [@hreoc1997;@herring2013]. Detailed in the Bringing Them Home report [@hreoc1997] are the many consequences of the forced removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and disconnection from their family, community, and culture. The consequences include the ongoing, intergenerational trauma of being removed as a child and/or having a child taken away, which often leads to higher rates of mental ill-health, suicidal ideation, and the use of alcohol and other drugs as a coping mechanism. Particularly for those removed, they also experience a lack of parenting skills due to the disruption of the passing on of knowledge and a disconnection from or not knowing their mob [@hreoc1997]. These consequences were not limited to just those with direct experience of the policies that led to the Stolen Generations, with many families today still experiencing intergenerational trauma perpetuated by their experiences of continuing excessive rates of child removals and systemic racism [@priest2011;@herring2013;@turnbull2022].

This historical context plays an important part in the contemporary operations of the child protection system and the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Before reviewing contemporary literature on the child protection system and the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who have contact with child protective services (CPS), it is important to review the legislative and policy frameworks that govern child protective services CPS in Western Australia (WA).

## Western Australia's child protection system

The child protection system in WA can be understood through three key elements:

1. Legislation, which outlines the legal framework by which WA's child protection agency, the Department of Communities, operates.
2. Government policy which sets out the ideological framework which is meant to underlie the goals and operations of the child protection system and related services, typically defining the goals and directives of the child protection system and, depending on the policy, the mechanisms by which they will be achieved and evaluated.
3. The operational standards of the child protection system, as presented in the Casework Practice Manual, which provides operational definitions of concepts used in child protection and requirements on standard working practices.

The legislation, policies, and procedures reviewed here predominantly relate to the mid-2000s through to the mid-2010s, as the data used in this thesis relates to this period. Policies which were released at the end of the 2010s or after 2020 not included here as their relevance to the data used for this thesis, which covers 2000 to 2020, is limited but are included in the discussion chapter to contextualise the findings of this research. This review so far has detailed the key aspects of the child protection system in Western Australia. The maltreatment definitions and different stages of the system are especially relevant for the next section, which reviews research into the child protection system. 

### Legislation {-}

The key piece of legislation which currently governs the child protection system in Western Australia is the *Child and Community Services Act 2004* [@ccsa2004] (hereafter "2004 Act"). The 2004 Act was amended in 2008 [@ccsa2008], making the reporting of sexual abuse mandatory for doctors, nurses, midwives, police officers, and teachers. It was further amended in 2021 [@ccsa2021], requiring CPS to consult with three different Aboriginal people, including a family member, when making decisions relating to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children [@ccsa2021]. The 2004 Act covers how to determine the best interests of the child, clauses on how child protective services must operate when working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, types of 'protection orders' that a child can be subjected to, the order of operations by which child protective services must operate, and who must be included in the decision-making process.

According to section 7, the best interests of the child are "paramount" to consideration when the act is being used to make decisions about said child. Section 8 goes on to define many aspects of a child's situation which must be considered when deciding what the best interests of the child are, such as:

* The need to protect the child from harm (a)
* The capacity of the child's parents to protect the child from harm (b)
* The nature of the child's relationships with various family members (d)
* Wishes expressed by the child (taking into consideration their age and understanding) (f)
* The importance of continuity and stability in living arrangements and the likely effect of disrupting this on the child (g)
* The child's cultural, ethnic, or religious identity (j)
* The child's physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, and developmental needs (k)

There are a total of 14 aspects which the 2004 Act identifies as requiring consideration, which goes some way to highlighting the complex nature of child protection cases. These aspects may operate against each other, for example, the child may wish to stay with a relative but the relative may not have the capacity to care for the child. Sub-section 8(j) is the first of several clauses that specifically identifies Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, mentioning the need to maintain connections with culture, lifestyle, and traditions. Section 9 of the 2004 Act states that supporting families and communities to care for a child is the preferred option (clause b) and that "intervention action" must only be taken when there is "no other reasonable way to safeguard and promote a child's wellbeing" (clause f).

There are several sections and clauses in the 2004 Act that govern how to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families, with Division 3, "Principles relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children", outlining several key aspects. Sub-section 12(2) instructs that placement of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children in OOHC must prioritise the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle (ATSICPP). The ATSICPP recognises the importance of Country, culture, community, and family to the identity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, with these aspects also intrinsic to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander concepts of permanence [@snaicc2016]. Placements must occur according to the following order of preference:

* Placement with a member of the child's family;
* Placement with a person who is an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander within the child's community in accordance with local customary practice;
* Placement with a person who is an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander;
* Placement with a person who is not an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander, but is sensitive to the child's cultural needs.

These are the most relevant aspects of the 2004 Act for this thesis and help contextualise the following policies of the Department of Communities.

### Policy {-}

**Signs of Safety Framework 2011**

The *Signs of Safety* framework was originally developed in WA in the 1990s by Turnell and Edwards [@turnell1999]. Edwards had many years' experience working in WA as a practitioner in the child protection system and felt that the theory and policy that informed child protection practice at the time had little correspondence with the real world [@sos2011].

The framework, which has been adopted in numerous jurisdictions around the world, is based on three core principles:

1. Constructive working relationships between professionals and family members, and between professionals;
2. Thinking critically and fostering a stance of inquiry - avoiding adopting a definitive view of a situation and being willing to be wrong;
3. Learning from practitioners and clients to improve outcomes, rather than 'top-down' practice informed by individuals who have never worked as a practitioner.

The goal of *Signs of Safety* is to create positive outcomes for vulnerable children, specifically, "rigorous, sustainable, everyday child safety in the actual home". This goal is said to be achieved by "[g]rowing the depths of practice ... among all child protection staff" [@sos2011, page 3]. The *Signs of Safety* document published by the Department of Communities [@sos2011] cites a considerable amount of evidence from around the world that demonstrates the success of *Signs of Safety* and its approach in improving outcomes for children and job satisfaction for practitioners. 

Collaboration between everyone involved in the child protection process appears throughout *Signs of Safety*. This collaboration seeks to avoid disenfranchisement, for example, disenfranchisement of parents due to rigid and risk-averse practice of caseworkers, or of caseworkers due to inflexible operational procedures set out by management. Collaboration is primarily in the process of safety planning, where the goal is to create a "proactive, structured, and monitored process that provides parents ... with a genuine opportunity, to demonstrate that they can provide the safety and the care for their children" [@sos2011, page 23]. In the planning process, *Signs of Safety* encourages the assessment of strengths of the parents and opportunities for safety as well as the risks in each child protection case, acknowledging that child protection agencies tend to be risk-averse - focusing almost solely on avoiding or preventing a negative outcome and the blame that comes with it. In this risk-averse mindset there is little space to consider a family's current strengths and opportunities to provide a safe environment. The purpose, then, of identifying strengths and opportunities and creating a good working relationship between parents and the Department of Communities, is to create meaningful and lasting safety plans that avoid the need for long-term involvement. 

Building strong working relationships between the parents and the Department of Communities will be critical for the WA government's pilot of Aboriginal Family-Led Decision Making (AFLDM) [@afldm2021]. This pilot intends to explore the impact of giving more say to Aboriginal perspectives in the child protection decisions, providing them space to make "culturally based and family-driven decisions". New South Wales [@nswafldm2020], Queensland [@qldafldm], South Australia [@saafldm2021], and Victoria [@vicafldm2019] have all trialled AFLDM. The success of this approach seem to depend greatly on the willingness of CPS staff to share power in the case management process, by giving more weight to input from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and Elders.

Another important aspect of *Signs of Safety* is how it should be implemented and evaluated. The methods and practices of the framework are to be embedded in the Department of Communities at all levels, through a 'learning journey' for the organisation over 2008 to 2013. *Signs of Safety* specifically states that the model of practice will have "limited impact unless organisational procedures, strategies and managerial style complement the practice approach". For this reason, a team of 'Practice Leaders' are created, who are senior practitioners in the organisation and experts in the Signs of Safety methods and provide support to caseworkers. Importantly, there is an acknowledgement that training staff and setting up these Practice Leaders is not the end of implementation - it requires long-term commitment and ongoing processes to embed the practices in the way the Department of Communities operates.

While *Signs of Safety* appears to be progressive and holistic in its implementation, the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC) reported mixed feedback from the Western Australian Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation (ACCO) sector [@snaicc2018]. ACCOs did not view *Signs of Safety* as culturally safe or competent, noting it did not promote participation in the decision-making process nor self-determination [@snaicc2018] - an issue that may be partially addressed by the AFLDM pilot.

With the *Child and Community Services Act 2004* providing the legal framework and *Signs of Safety* providing the ideological framework, the Department of Communities has published a number of other policy documents which outline specific child protection goals and the strategies by which the Department of Communities means to achieve them. Each of these documents relates to specific aspects of the child protection system, but together they describe the strategies the Department of Communities planned to use to reduce the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care. The Department of Communities published its most relevant documents for the period of time this thesis examines over the course of the 2010s, which address the areas the Department of Communities considered key in reducing the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children:

- Aboriginal Services and Practice Framework 2016-2018
- Remote Services Framework 2014
- Building Safe and Strong Families 2016
- Building a Better Future, Out-of-Home Care Reform in Western Australia 2016
- Better care, better services 2017

**Aboriginal Services and Practice Framework 2016-2018**

The *Aboriginal Services and Practice Framework* [@aspf2016] describes practices for improving outcomes for Aboriginal children who come into contact with the child protection system. This policy document references the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children 2009-2020 [@nfpac], aligning itself with the goals of reducing the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the child protection system and delivering culturally appropriate care and support to those children who are in the system. The way the Department of Communities planned to achieve this is by building a genuine partnership between the Department of Communities and Aboriginal families, organisations, and communities. Examples include involving Aboriginal communities and leadership in the development of policies and services, incorporating self-determination into the Department of Communities' strategy, and supporting Aboriginal families throughout the child protection process. The *Aboriginal Services and Practice Framework* identifies four priority areas: 

1. Capacity building - including the development of Aboriginal community-controlled organisations (ACCOs) and support of flexible service delivery.
2. Community engagement - where relationships with local Aboriginal communities and organisations are developed.
3. Practice development - where Aboriginal worldviews and values are incorporated into service, policy, and practice, to deliver a culturally safe practice. 
4. People development - which focuses on two-way learning between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal staff.

Overall, the *Aboriginal Services and Practice Framework* clearly supports empowering Aboriginal families and communities in respect to the child protection system. It acknowledges the importance of understanding Aboriginal cultures and the nuanced differences in each community, which is a key sentiment in *Signs of Safety*. The implementation of the *Aboriginal Services and Practice Framework* may pose a challenge however, in particular the employment of Aboriginal staff to act as references in cases involving Aboriginal children. 

In a meeting with the community reference group for the Indigenous Child Removals Western Australia (I-CaRe WA) study, the broader research study that my PhD research was a part of, several attendees identified that Aboriginal caseworkers at the Department of Communities were often overloaded and unable to give the attention required in every case. This comment was also made in qualitative interviews with ACCO staff [@jones2021], with Aboriginal caseworkers not being involved in a case unless there was a high level of conflict and tension between the family and the Department of Communities. The combination of high workloads and workplace racism are likely contributors to the turnover of Aboriginal caseworkers [@oates2020], which presents a barrier to achieving the goals of this framework.

**Remote Services Framework 2014**

While the *Aboriginal Services and Practice Framework 2016-2018* relates to all Aboriginal families and communities in Western Australia, the *Remote Services Framework 2014* [@rsf2014] lays out specifically how the Department of Communities planned to work with remote communities. According to the Department of Communities, a remote community is "A discrete geographic location that is considerably isolated from larger regional towns and where predominantly Aboriginal children and families reside" [@rsf2014]. It is important to consider this geographic aspect, as there are approximately 12,000 people living across 200 remote Aboriginal communities in WA [@doc2023] - a state 2.6 million square kilometres in size.

The main takeaway of the *Remote Services Framework* is the definition of Senior Community Child Protection Workers-Remote (SCCPW-R), a role that is designed to promote the well-being of Aboriginal children, young people, families and communities in eleven remote Aboriginal communities. The SCCPW-Rs are responsible for inter-agency collaboration and the management of child protection case meetings, which involve the discussion of a child's risk by the Department of Communities, the local police and school, and other child protection-related agencies. They are also responsible for supporting families through the child protection system, including working towards reunification, and engaging families, communities, and Elders, to develop localised child protection solutions and educate the community on child safety and well-being.

**Building Safe and Strong Families 2016**

The previous two policies were more instructional on specific aspects of the child protection system, namely working with Aboriginal children and families generally and in a remote setting. The *Building Safe and Strong Families 2016* document is a review by the Department of Communities of the child protection system at the time, drawing on consultations with "children, parents, birth families, carers, the community services sector, Aboriginal organisations, Department staff, other government agencies and numerous other stakeholders" [@bssf2016, page 6] in Western Australia. At the outset the document acknowledges that rates of removal for Aboriginal children have not been reducing, with Aboriginal children representing 53% of all children in out-of-home care in Western Australia, despite only making up 6.7% of the child population [@bssf2016]. Importantly, the document acknowledges the intergenerational issues and their complex relationships that Aboriginal families face which put them at greater risk of child protection involvement. The document reiterates the goal of preventing children from entering care, and lays out four focus areas and actions needed to address them:

1. Delivering shared outcomes with collective effort - identifying the need for collaboration between the Department of Communities and other government departments as well as contracted service providers.
2. A culturally competent service system - acknowledging that to improve outcomes for Aboriginal children and families, services need to be culturally competent. For example, service delivery by Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations and employing more Aboriginal people to work at the Department of Communities.
3. Diverting families from the child protection system through the use of "sophisticated data and information collection mechanisms", which can identify families at risk to then provide intensive support to prevent interaction with the child protection system.
4. Preventing children from entering out-of-home care - specifically the further embedding of the Signs of Safety framework (noting its implementation began five years earlier) and the formation of "Intensive Family Support Teams".

*Building Safe and Strong Families 2016* makes the same points as the prior two policies, making that the Department of Communities remained focused on reducing the rate of over-representation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care, and planned to do this through support to prevent interaction with the system in the first place. 

**Building a Better Future 2016**

Published a few months later in 2016, *Building a Better Future 2016* [@babf2016] includes substantive updates on the Department of Communities' strategy relating to child protection issues. Proposals for legislative amendments and changes to practice and long-term goals were made. The overall goals remain the same - implementing preventive strategies to reduce the rate of Aboriginal children entering out-of-home care and reduce their rate of over-representation, with this being achieved through collaboration and a culturally sensitive, holistic approach to child protection. However, the document outlines the plan to arrive at permanency decisions earlier, with permanency defined as reunification or permanent out-of-home care. The legislative proposal here was to reduce the maximum duration of extensions to temporary protection orders to 12 months, down from 24 months. This means the maximum total time a child can be on a temporary order is 24 months with extensions, rather than 36 months, effectively leading to earlier permanency decisions. Considering the challenges that some families face can take a long time to resolve, making permanency decisions earlier may put children at greater risk of permanent out-of-home care and reduce the likelihood of reunification.

**Better care, better services 2017**

Finally, the *Better care, better services 2017* document [@bcbs2017] is an update to the original 2006 standards, incorporating aspects of the other documents covered thus far and consultation with a variety of stakeholders, such as staff at the Department of Communities, children in care, and organisations in the out-of-home care sector. The main component is the identification of nine standards by which the Department of Communities intends the child protection system to operate and many associated measures of compliance to said standards. In the context of my research, standards 1 and 3 are especially relevant [@bcbs2017, page 7]:

- Standard 1 - "Children ... are provided with, and experience, stability and consistency during their time in care".
- Standard 3 - "Aboriginal children ... are supported to maintain meaningful connections to their family, community, land, and culture, in accordance with the ... Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle".

The main addition *Better care, better services 2017* provides to the policy literature is a set of specific criteria by which the Department of Communities' operations and the overall child protection sector can be evaluated.

### Casework Practice Manual {-}

The Casework Practice Manual [@caseworkmanual] lays out the operational aspects of the child protection system in Western Australia. I will identify some key elements here, relevant to the metrics used by the Department of Communities as well as those seen in broader research on the child protection system. Figure \@ref(fig:overview) shows an overview of the child protection system, with the flow in the stages of the system and the broader governing policy and law.

```{r overview, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap="A broad overview of pathways through child protective services.\\newline{}Source: Figure 16.1, Report on Government Services 2024", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here("1_lit_review","img","rogs-fig.png"))
```

Child protection cases start at the notification stage, which is when the Department of Communities is made aware of a concern for a child's safety or well-being. These notifications can come from anyone, but commonly come from teachers, social workers, police, or medical professionals, as these professions have mandatory reporting requirements. If the notification contains a concern regarding maltreatment of the child or abandonment or inadequate provision of care then it progresses to a formal investigation by the Department of Communities [@caseworkmanual, section 2.2.3].

Investigations must be completed within 30 calendar days and determine whether the child has or is likely to experience harm as a result of abuse, whether the parents have the capacity to protect the child from harm, and whether the child is in need of protection [@caseworkmanual, section 2.2.4]. If the investigation involves an Aboriginal child, then an Aboriginal practice leader at the Department of Communities must be consulted to ensure the investigation process is culturally safe.

After the investigation, a decision is made on whether the concern is substantiated. When maltreatment is substantiated, it is categorised into one of four categories, noting that a child can have multiple different categories of substantiated maltreatment:

- Physical abuse - "when a child is severely and/or persistently hurt or injured by an adult or a child's caregiver" [@dcpphysical].
- Emotional abuse - "when an adult harms a child’s development by repeatedly treating and speaking to a child in ways that damage the child’s ability to feel and express their feelings" [@dcpemotional].
- Sexual abuse - "when a child is exposed to, or involved in, sexual activity that is inappropriate to the child’s age and developmental level" [@dcpsexual]
- Neglect - "when children do not receive adequate food or shelter, medical treatment, supervision, care or nurturance to such an extent that their development is damaged or they are injured" [@dcpneglect]

The substantiation itself can be one of two types, either substantiation of actual harm occurring, or substantiation that the child is at risk of harm occurring. Here, harm is the focus rather than abuse, as the Department of Communities considers harm to be the detrimental impact of abuse. 

Once a decision has been made regarding substantiation, there is a conclusion of the investigation. Depending on the case, the Department of Communities may opt to provide support services to the family to help address any concerns and avoid removing the child. There may also have been the provision of universal prevention services prior to reaching this point. The Department of Communities may apply to the court for a protection order, which typically begin as a temporary protection order. There are two types of temporary protection order, a supervision order and a time-limited order. The former leaves the child in the care of their parents, but the Department of Communities supervises the care of the child and places conditions on the parents that they must adhere to. The latter type removes the child from their family temporarily and places them under the care of the Department of Communities, typically with a foster carer.

The maximum duration for temporary protection orders is two years. If the parents of the child are unable to meet the Department of Communities' conditions for reunification then the Department of Communities can apply for a permanent protection order, meaning the child will be placed in out-of-home care until the age of 18. It is possible for a permanent protection order to be cancelled before this age, however it requires a legal challenge to the order which may not be feasible for many families. There are also two types of permanent protection order. The 'until 18' order is effectively the permanent version of the 'time-limited' temporary order. The other permanent protection order is the 'special guardianship' order, which assigns parental responsibility to up to two people who are not the Department of Communities or the child's parents.

With regards to placements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children into out-of-home care, they must be placed according to the ATSICPP [@ccsa2004]. From @snaicc2013, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle aims to:

- Recognise and protect the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, family members and communities;
- Increase the level of self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in child welfare matters;
- Reduce the disproportionate representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the child protection system.

The goals of the principle are aligned with those of the Department of Communities, however there is a disconnect between the way the Department of Communities views permanency and how it is considered in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. The tie to family, culture, community, and Country is a key concept in permanency for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's identity [@snaicc2016]. The Department of Communities however, only views permanency in terms of a long-term attachment with a caregiver, which does not incorporate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of experiencing permanency [@snaicc2019].

One final aspect of the child protection system, which is relevant for my research, is informal and formal out-of-home care arrangements. Formal care arrangements are those which occur under the legislative apparatus via the different types of protection orders. Informal care arrangements are where an individual close to the child, often a family member, takes on the care of the child without going through the formal processes of the Department of Communities [@caseworkmanual, section 1.2.3]. These arrangements can be beneficial for Aboriginal families as on one hand the child remains with their family and cultural group - the best outcome for them. The downside to these placements is that the Department provides limited financial assistance in the form of a one-off payment of up to $1,000, to the families caring for children in informal care arrangements, placing an additional financial burden on informal carers.

The themes emerging from this review of legislature, policy, and operational manuals are that the Department of Communities was aiming to:

1. Reduce the over-representation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care, primarily through preventive measures to avoid children being in situations that would require involvement of CPS.
2. Keep children with their families when they do come to the attention of CPS, by providing early-intervention and intensive family support services.
3. Provide culturally competent services to families and training for its staff, including employing more Aboriginal staff and contracting ACCOs.

These policies and operational requirements published by the Department of Communities suggest there is an organisational desire to reduce the number of Aboriginal children going into care and to keep Aboriginal children connected to their communities. Bringing about these changes will likely be challenging however, given the complexity and inter-relatedness of factors underlying why children enter OOHC and why Aboriginal children in particular are over-represented. While the Department of Communities should still work toward their aims, addressing the structural causes would require a whole-of-government approach. 

## Child protection and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children

### Trends in contacts {-}

Across Australia, rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child removals have not been reducing, despite the nation-wide imperative of the Closing the Gap target of reducing their rate of over-representation in child protection statistics, a target not currently on track to be met [@ctg2020;@aihw2022]. Children are also being removed at younger ages and remaining in the child protection system for longer [@zhou2010]. These two things are naturally correlated, as the younger a child is at removal, the more potential years they have to remain in the system. @bilson2017 noted the percentage of children aged under one entering care in WA for the first time rose from 15.3% to 24.8% between 1996 and 2009. The authors also note the proportion of care episodes that lasted longer than one year increased from 20.1% to 57.6% in the same time period. Notifications that occur during the antenatal period also play a significant role in the removal of children before their first birthday, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children being four times more likely to be the subject of a pre-birth notification than non-Indigenous children, and six times more likely to be placed in OOHC before the age of one [@odonnell2023].

In other parts of Australia, the same trends have been noted. In the Northern Territory the rate of notifications and substantiations increased between 1999 and 2010, with @guthridge2012 finding for non-Indigenous children the rate of notifications doubled from 20.0 to 41.9 per 1,000 between the 1999-2002 and 2007-2010 periods. For Aboriginal children, the increase was even greater, with notifications increasing from 29.4 to 134.2 per 1,000 and substantiations from 9.3 to 34.2 per 1,000. In South Australia, @segal2019 report similar findings, with younger cohorts of children being subjects of investigations and substantiations in greater numbers and at earlier ages; although for the youngest cohort, those born 2010 to 2017, the rates appear to have stopped increasing. Again, the numbers are far greater for Aboriginal children where approximately 7% of non-Indigenous children had an investigation by age 18 whereas this was between 30% to 40% for Aboriginal children. For substantiations by age 18 the numbers were around 4% for non-Indigenous children compared to between 19% and 25% for Aboriginal children. This trend exists Australia-wide, with the ratio of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to non-Indigenous children in out-of-home care increasing from 6.5:1 to 9.5:1 between 1997 and 2015 [@jones2017].

An important aspect to bear in mind regarding the effects of policy and legislative change is their impact on administrative data and the concepts recorded within. An example of this is in WA, where the introduction of the Child and Community Services Act 2004, which came into effect in 2006, appears to have had a notable impact on the frequency of notifications and investigations. Prior to the 2004 Act coming in to effect, notifications were based on 'child maltreatment allegations' which specifically detailed allegations of maltreatment and were required to be investigated, and 'child concern reports' that did not specifically detail allegations of maltreatment and were not required to be investigated. Following the implementation of the 2004 Act in 2006, notifications were more broadly defined as concerns for a child's wellbeing, which includes reports that did not allege maltreatment. The impact of this changing definition is demonstrated in @bilson2017, who report an increase in the number of notifications and investigations, captured in Figure \@ref(fig:bilson2017) of their paper, presented below.

```{r bilson2017, fig.cap="Annual interactions with the child protection system in Western Australia. \\newline{}Source: Bilson et al. (2017), Figure 2. Reproduced with permission.", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("1_lit_review","img","bilson2017fig2.png"))
```

What is notable about this graph is that while the number of notifications and investigations increased following the introduction of the 2004 Act, the number of substantiations barely increased and the number of children recorded as being harmed did not change. This suggests the rate of child abuse remained constant, which is likely as already unlawful behaviour is unlikely to be affected by the introduction of new laws. That each stage of the child protection system, from notifications through to placements in OOHC, sees an ever-decreasing number of children is characteristic of all child protection systems - the greatest number of CPS contacts occur at the notifications stage, with not all of these being investigated, not all investigations resulting in substantiated maltreatment, and not all substantiated maltreatment leading to a child being placed in OOHC [@bilson2015;@falster2020].

The type of maltreatment recorded appears to have a relationship to the length of time children spend in OOHC and the probability that they will be reunified. In both Western Australia and South Australia, children who were considered to be neglected were more likely to spend more than a year in OOHC and were less likely to be reunified [@delfabbro2003;@barber2009;@bilson2017]. These studies consider all children, not just Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children. However, these studies report that neglect was much more likely to be the recorded maltreatment type for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander who were placed in OOHC. This is consistent with national reporting where neglect represents around 30% of substantiated maltreatment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, compared to around 17% for non-Indigenous children [@aihw2022], highlighting the importance that maltreatment type plays in rates of over-representation.

### Factors relating to child protection involvement {-}

*Parental demographics*

A common finding is that children born to younger parents, in particular teenage parents, are more likely to have interactions with the child protection system. In a Western Australian study, @odonnell2010a found non-Indigenous children with mothers aged under 20 years old at the time of birth were 2.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.16 to 3.42) times more likely to have a substantiated allegation, compared to the reference group of mothers aged 30-39. This association was not observed for Indigenous children with teenage mothers or fathers, with hazard ratios confidence intervals too wide to be interpretable. @orr2019 conducted a similar study in Western Australia, using the same data linkage methods with a larger cohort of children, but focusing on risk of allegation, rather than substantiation. It appeared that Aboriginal children were at greater risk of allegation when born to younger mothers, compared to the same reference group of mothers aged 30-39. @orr2019 reported hazard ratios for maltreatment allegations for children born to a mother aged under 20 of 1.73 (95% CI (1.51 to 1.98), and 1.16 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.32) for fathers aged under 20. Children who were born to single parents have also been identified as being at greater risk of interacting with the child protection system [@odonnell2010a;@odonnell2015;@odonnell2019;@orr2019].

Where families live is also relevant, as families living in metropolitan areas were the most likely to have a child removed compared to other levels of remoteness in Western Australia and nationally [@odonnell2019;@aihw2022;@lima2024]. Conversely, families living in rural areas appear to be less likely to be reunified with their children than families living in urban areas [@delfabbro2003;@barber2009].

*Parental health*

Studies analysing administrative data from various jurisdictions across Australia all identify that poor parental mental health, in particular poor maternal mental health, is associated with increased risk of interaction with CPS. In Queensland, @jenkins2018 reported unadjusted hazard ratios of 1.67 for substantiated abuse and 2.01 for intervention by the child protection system, for children whose primary parent has or had a mental health problem. However the authors do not distinguish between outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous children and did not provide confidence intervals around their estimates. @odonnell2010a conduct a more detailed analysis of Aboriginal children whose mothers had a recorded mental health contact, finding they were 1.33 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.95) times more likely to have a substantiated allegation of maltreatment compared to children whose mothers did not have a mental health contact. For paternal mental health contacts this was 1.42 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.25). In a later study of the general WA population, @odonnell2015 found children of mothers with mental health contacts and a maltreatment allegation were more likely to be Aboriginal (32.2%), born to single mothers (33.6%), born to teenage mothers (15.7%) and teenage fathers (4.3%), and live in the most socio-economically disadvantaged areas (28.1%). Separate to mental health, mothers with intellectual disabilities are also more likely to have their children removed [@lima2022].

*Parental substance use*

Analyses of substance use, including alcohol and other drugs, generally find that any kind of substance use increases the risk of interaction with CPS. In Queensland, @jenkins2018 reported unadjusted hazard ratios for parental substance use and risk of notifications, investigations, substantiations, and interventions of 1.52, 1.91, 2.60, and 3.19 respectively. Using Western Australian data, hazard ratios for maternal substance use demonstrated an increased risk of maltreatment allegations (2.13, 95% CI 1.95 to 2.36 [@orr2019]) and substantiated maltreatment for Aboriginal children (1.82, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.71 [@odonnell2010a]). Paternal substance use also increased the risk, but to a lesser extent with hazard ratios of 1.68 (95% CI 1.55 to 1.81 [@orr2019]) and 1.56 (95% CI 0.93 to 2.62 [@odonnell2010a]) respectively. That parental substance use is comorbid with parental mental ill-health is important as both of these factors independently increase the risk of contact with CPS and child removal [@oleary2020;@tan2022].

*Family and domestic violence*

@orr2019 highlights in Western Australia that the 2004 Act [@ccsa2004] states children are in need of protection if they are exposed to family and domestic violence (FDV), with the perpetrator of the violence being responsible for emotional abuse. Nationally, emotional abuse was the most common type of maltreatment in 2017-18 [@familymatters2019]. Prior research has indicated a 30-50% co-occurrence of child abuse and family and domestic violence, however this relationship is complex as parental substance misuse and poor mental health are common in families of children who are exposed to interpersonal violence [@orr2019]. Studies which have examined the increased risk of involvement of CPS found the rate of contact tends to be between 50% to 150% higher for families experiencing family and domestic violence [@jenkins2018;@orr2019].

*Justice system*

When a parent becomes incarcerated their children are at an increased risk of being placed in OOHC. Aboriginal children whose mothers were incarcerated were more than 12 times more likely to be placed in OOHC than Aboriginal children whose mothers were not, even when there had been no prior contacts with CPS [@segal2023]. One of the consequences of children being removed during periods of incarceration is that it becomes harder for parents to seek reunification once they exit the prison system, due to not having been involved in the child protection processes [@newton2020]. The intersection between children who have experience of OOHC and their subsequent involvement in the juvenile system is also well documented [@doolan2013;@malvaso2017;@lima2019;@leckning2023]. These children may grow up and go on to have children of their own, where a parental history of child protection involvement and incarceration makes them more likely to have their own children removed [@jenkins2018;@armfield2021], continuing the cycle of child removal.

*Previous child having been removed*

There is a gap in the literature in relation to this factor. Having a child removed by the child protection system in WA is, by design of the Child and Community Services Act 2004, potentially one of the strongest predictors of subsequent child removal. Section 33A stipulates "If, before a child is born, the CEO receives information that raises concerns about the child's wellbeing after the child is born, the CEO may cause any inquiries to be made that the CEO considers reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether action should be taken to safeguard or promote the child's wellbeing after the child is born". The 'information' could come in the form of a report, however if a child is to be born to a parent with another child already on a protection order this might raise concern about the child's well-being after they are born. One of the few studies to examine this is @jenkins2018, who reported that households in Queensland with a prior, ongoing intervention had an unadjusted hazard ratio of 3.16 for subsequent child protection involvement.

*Socio-economic disadvantage*

In the majority of studies, the most socio-economically disadvantaged families are the ones that are most likely to have interactions with CPS, including having children removed [@jenkins2018;@odonnell2019;@segal2019]. The more socio-economic disadvantage experienced by a child and their family, the more likely they are to have interactions with the child protection system as socio-economic status is intertwined with many of the aforementioned risk factors. Housing quality is also related to socio-economic disadvantage, which is particularly relevant when overcrowded and poor-quality housing are risk factors for child protection involvement and are themselves considered forms of neglect - despite often being outside of a family's control [@dcpneglect]. This is important to acknowledge as it puts into perspective that structural barriers often cause these individual-level risk factors covered thus far. For parents who rely on financial welfare, having a child removed can also further entrench poverty, through changes to a parent’s welfare payments [@bennett2020].

*Indigenous status*

Many of the studies reported compare data for non-Indigenous children to data for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. @odonnell2019 report an odds ratio of 1.86 (95% CI 1.65 to 2.09) for the increased risk of placement into OOHC for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Western Australia, while in Queensland @jenkins2018 report a hazard ratio of 2.28 for child protection intervention. In South Australia, @segal2019 do not directly estimate the difference between these two groups, but reported 13% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in South Australia had some experience of OOHC by age 18 compared to less than 2% of non-Indigenous children. These findings all demonstrate the increased risk of CPS contact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families face, however this is only part of the picture for why their children represent more than half of all children in OOHC nationally [@aihw2022]. This over-representation is also due to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children entering care at younger ages and spending longer periods in OOHC than non-Indigenous children [@bilson2017]. 

It is important to consider how Indigenous status is interpreted as a risk factor. Viewing it alone risks perpetuating the narrative that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are poor or abusive parents who are unable to take care of their children [@abcnews]. Colonisation, dispossession of land, and generations of child removals have had a devastating and lasting impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, which can be seen in the interruption of passing on of parenting practices and the increased risk of living in poverty or low socio-economic areas, engaging in substance use, or having poor mental health [@hreoc1997]; factors which place them at greater risk of interaction with the child protection system. The experiences of colonisation and the consequences of the Stolen Generations are unique to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. While the policy of the Stolen Generations ended in the 1970s, many people today still see child protective services as one and the same as those responsible for the forced removal of children under the Stolen Generations policy [@ivec2012].

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people also experience systemic racism and marginalisation, which increases the risk of negative outcomes arising from interactions with CPS [@davis2019]. Systemic racism can play out in many ways, such as a caseworker's perception of traditional Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander parenting practices and family structures as forms of maltreatment [@fernandez2014;@duthie2019;@harnett2020;@oates2020], or over-policing leading to increased notifications, where police officers are responsible for a large proportion of all notifications made to CPS [@guthridge2012], or mandatory reporting by a health professional for neglect due to delaying seeking healthcare, where avoiding seeking healthcare can be due to racism experienced within healthcare services and the fear of being reported [@guthrie2020].

This literature makes it evident that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children continue to be over-represented in child protection statistics and their over-representation is seemingly unchanged or worsening. The individual-level risk factors associated with the increased risk of CPS involvement seem to be driven by systemic issues, as seen in the commentary on systemic racism and entrenched disadvantage. That these systemic problems persist despite policies of state governments aiming to address over-representation, like the policies reviewed for WA, is something to reflect on. It is possible that making systemic changes to address structural causes will take longer than a two-decade period to achieve, explaining why we have yet to see substantial progress toward targets of reducing over-representation. It is also possible that despite the best intentions as outlined in government policies, their implementation is harder than their creation and the timeframe needed to make large systemic change is longer than the lifespan of the policies.

### Health in child protection contexts {-}

The research literature on the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is vast, as health is a broad topic both in terms of types of conditions and their determinants. National reporting provides a broad overview of this topic, with the leading causes of the health burden among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 0 to 14 being asthma and mental health conditions [@aihw2020c]. For children aged under five, the most common conditions were congenital conditions such as complications of low birthweight, while for children aged 5 to 14, mental health conditions including conduct, anxiety, and depressive disorders, dental caries, and asthma, were the leading causes of health burden. There are also positive health outcomes, such as high rates of immunisations among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children at age two. While there is a large literature on children's health generally, there is little that examines the health of children in out-of-home care which is specifically acknowledged in the *Australia's Children* report [@aihw2020c]. It is important to know whether Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care have a different health profile than Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children more broadly. If they are indeed a subgroup with differential experiences of health then this should be reflected in the design of support services aimed at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in care or at risk of entering care.

*Health needs as a risk factors for CPS involvement*

Several health conditions have been identified as increasing the risk of contact with CPS. Children with cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and other birth defects or disabilities, are often at increased risk of contact with the child protection system [@odonnell2010a;@odonnell2015;@maclean2017]. In an earlier study, @odonnell2009 also identified that Aboriginal mothers were twice as likely to have a child that develops neonatal withdrawal syndrome, a condition where the infant experiences withdrawal from a substance their mother used during pregnancy and which also increases their risk of being removed. In a review of patient records at a specialist facility in WA that diagnoses and treats foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, @tan2022 found 47% of the 163 Aboriginal children seen by the clinic had some level of child protection involvement, with conditions like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, intellectual disability, and depression being comorbid with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

These health conditions are not by themselves a reason for children to be removed, however the precursory factors that lead to these conditions, such as substance use and smoking during in pregnancy, are also factors that put children at greater risk of being removed. This illustrates the inter-relatedness of risk factors for both negative child health outcomes and interactions with the child protection system. Taking a further step back, smoking and substance use during pregnancy may be a coping mechanism for broader difficulties faced by mothers, such as poor maternal mental health, poor housing and homelessness, poverty, lack of access to support services, historical trauma, and systemic racism [@davis2019;@familymatters2020]. 

*Health needs of children in out-of-home care*

The health conditions discussed previously are one part of the health picture. The studies reporting on these conditions identify an increased risk of appearing in child protection data, but they do not tell us the broader health profile of children going into care. Knowing the health profile is important, both for carers as well as for the Department of Communities and related organisations in terms of service provision. For carers, knowing what health conditions a child has enables them to seek the necessary care to ensure the child has good health. In qualitative interviews conducted as part of the I-CaRe WA study, several carers raised that the Department of Communities was not passing on any health information, which made it difficult for them to be able to care for the child effectively. For the Department of Communities, knowing what health conditions tend to be common means they can plan early-intervention services to help promote positive development and wellbeing in the early stages of life. From a purely economic perspective, @alperstein2012 demonstrated how this strategy is more cost effective than treating ill-health and other poor outcomes in later life, with promoting good health in children as they develop also affecting other areas of their lives, such as education and social outcomes [@aihw2020c].

In a study of children attending OOHC clinics operated by KARI Aboriginal Resources Inc. in south-western Sydney, half of the children had incomplete immunisation schedules [@raman2011]. This is considerably lower than the reported 88% immunisation rate for all children reported in the *Australia's Children* report [@aihw2020c]. While this finding may only be representative of children in south-western Sydney, it illustrates how a particular health condition may be an issue for children in out-of-home care, but perhaps not for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children more broadly. In a follow-up study of the same clinics, @raman2017 identified referrals for asthma, visual impairment, and dental issues were common for children seen by the clinic across multiple years. These findings were similar to a later study published by @shmerling2020, who performed a similar analysis of children attending Victorian Aboriginal Health services - with the prevalence of respiratory conditions, visual impairment, and dental issues also in the 30% to 50% range. Both of these studies also found that poor mental health, delays in speech development, and behavioural difficulties were common. Studies of specialist referrals for children, not exclusively Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, entering OOHC were similar, finding the same types of referrals but also that children often needed multiple referrals to meet their multiple and complex healthcare needs [@nathanson2007;@kaltner2011;@arora2014;@mclean2019;@mclean2022]. 

While these studies are useful to identify what conditions are common in different cohorts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with experience of OOHC, they do not tell us whether their health needs are different from comparable cohorts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with no experience of OOHC. There have also been no similar studies of specialist referrals published for Western Australian children. Due to the differences in geography and climate between New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia, the findings of these studies should not be extrapolated. For example, there are a wide variety of climates across Western Australia - a factor relevant for asthma and that a far greater proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities live in remote regions in Western Australia [@aihw2019b], where increasing remoteness is associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing poor health [@aihw2020c;@dohwa2021].

*Maternal health*

Setting up a child for positive health starts during pregnancy, with the mother's health and behaviours affecting the child's birth outcomes and future health. Factors known to be associated with increased risk of child protection involvement, such as substance use during pregnancy, also contribute to poor birth outcomes like low birthweight [@lima2023]. Low birthweight is twice as likely to occur in babies of mothers who experienced family and domestic violence during pregnancy [@brown2015], recalling that family and domestic violence is itself risk factor for CPS involvement; highlighting a common of risk factor for poor child health and child protection involvement. These poor birth outcomes are also themselves risk factors for poor health in later life, such as developing diabetes [@aihw2020c].

*Mental health*

For children in OOHC generally, the risk of experiencing poor mental health during childhood is greater than for children with no CPS involvement, with this increased risk of poor mental health persisting through adulthood [@jones2017;@lima2019]. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children specifically, irrespective of CPS involvement, they have a higher risk of poor mental health [@aihw2020c]. It follows, then, that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with experience of OOHC are at the highest risk of poor mental health, compared to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children without CPS involvement and compared to non-Indigenous children with experience of OOHC [@lima2019;@leckning2021;@leckning2023]. The Study of Environment on Aboriginal Resilience and Child Health (SEARCH) in New South Wales identified that children raised by their biological parents or other relatives were more likely to have good mental health, where being raised by a foster or other carer had an associated odds ratio of 0.28 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.71, [@williamson2016]). Further work using data linkage with the SEARCH cohort identified that children living with foster carers were also at greater risk of having mental health  admissions compared to children living with their biological family [@williamson2018]; the rate ratio for emergency department presentation was 2.00 (95% credible interval 0.93 to 4.47) and for hospital admission was 4.24 (95% credible interval 0.99 to 18.33).

*Hospitalisations*

As seen in some of the studies mentioned previously, linked administrative data can be a useful source of information on health and child protection. Data linkages commonly include hospital and emergency department records, which can be examined to calculate rates of hospitalisations and the kinds of conditions being admitted. In an analysis of South Australian data, @gnanamanickam2020 found that children, both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous, who were ever-placed in OOHC had the highest cumulative incidence of hospitalisations, having an incidence rate approximately twice as high as children with no CPS involvement. In terms of the conditions for children with any CPS involvement, respiratory conditions and ear, nose and throat conditions were the most common for children under the age of 12 and mental disorders were common for those aged 13 to 17, consistent with national reporting [@aihw2019]. That respiratory, ear, nose, and throat conditions were the most common is important as these conditions can typically be managed in a primary care setting. These kinds of admissions are referred to as *potentially preventable hospitalisations* (PPHs) and are defined as "hospital admissions that could have potentially been prevented through the provision of appropriate individualised preventative health interventions and early disease management" [@aihw2019].

While PPHs tend to occur more often in areas where there is a higher rate of disease, by examining PPHs we can also gain an understanding of the accessibility and efficacy of healthcare and social support services in the region where the hospital is located. For example, if there are high rates of PPHs in a particular hospital, it may suggest that primary healthcare and support services are unavailable, inaccessible, or not addressing the health needs of the community. The AIHW advises caution in interpreting rates of PPHs, commenting that higher rates do not always mean that primary care is less effective [@aihw2019], and that potentially preventable admissions could not always have been prevented - they are just a set of conditions which *may* have been preventable. The conditions which fall under potentially preventable admissions fall into one of three groups:

1. Chronic conditions, which could have been prevented if the condition was managed in the community or by lifestyle changes;
2. Acute conditions, which could have been prevented if adequate primary care was provided in time;
3. Vaccine-preventable conditions, which tend to be either influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis C [@aihw2019].  

Potentially preventable hospitalisations in the context of data linkage studies can examine health and healthcare system performance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children generally and in the context of the child protection system. There have not been any studies examining PPHs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children according to their experience of OOHC, however some studies have compared PPHs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children generally to PPHs for non-Indigenous children. In the Northern Territory, @li2009 examined PPHs between 1998 and 2006, finding a rate of PPH admissions four times higher for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. In New South Wales between 2000 and 2012, the rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 0 to 13 was 1.7 times higher [@falster2016]. In South Australia, @procter2020 compared how the incidence rate of PPHs for children varied depending on the definition used, comparing the adult definition used by the AIHW to a child-specific definition developed by @anderson2012. The child definition identified a higher rate of PPHs overall, however when comparing rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and non-Indigenous children, the incidence rate ratios were lower using the child definition, at 1.52, than under the adult definition at 1.87. Finally, in a multi-jurisdictional analysis covering New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, @stamp1998 estimated rates of admissions for PPHs. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 28 days to 1 year old had rates 11.1 times higher compared to non-Indigenous children in the same age bracket, and for children aged 1 to 4 years old the rate was 1.7 times higher. These findings for children are consistent with findings for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people more generally, where the @aihw2019 reports that the rate of PPHs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is three times higher than that for non-Indigenous Australians. They also report that increasing remoteness is also associated with increasing rates of PPHs, independent of Indigenous status.

The overall rate of PPHs is consistently higher for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and adults, but what are the main conditions driving PPHs? In nationally published data for children, ear, nose, and throat infections were common [@aihw2020b]. Nearly a quarter of PPHs in children in the Australian Capital Territory aged under 5 were for respiratory disease [@guthrie2012], with injury and infectious diseases also frequently appearing. In New South Wales, a comparative analysis of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and non-Indigenous children showed that respiratory conditions and infectious diseases were the most common causes of admission, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children being admitted more frequently for all conditions that defined PPHs [@falster2016]. 

Despite much research examining PPHs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, none of it examines rates of PPHs nor the types of conditions according to whether they had involvement with CPS; these studies either examine rates of PPHs for Aboriginal and Torres strait Islander children as compared to non-Indigenous children without consideration of CPS involvement [@stamp1998;@li2009;@falster2016;@procter2020], or examine rates of PPHs for children with or without CPS involvement but do not report results for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children separately [@gnanamanickam2020].

## Conclusion

To summarise, it is generally well established that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have an inequitable burden of disease relative to non-Indigenous children, with their health and wellbeing needs not being adequately met by current systems of healthcare. Further, their over-representation in child protection statistics continues, despite the aspirations of state and federal government policy [@aspf2016;@bssf2016;@ctg2020;@familymatters2023;@ctgreview2024]. First placements in OOHC occurring increasingly younger ages is a driving factor in the increasing rates of over-representation [@zhou2010;@bilson2017;@odonnell2023], as children are entering OOHC younger and staying in care for longer. While there are many individual-level risk factors that increase the risk of CPS involvement, such as parental substance use, exposure to family and domestic violence, and poor parental mental health, these risk factors have roots in broader systemic issues such as poverty and racism [@davis2019;@guthrie2020;@familymatters2021].

These systemic issues also have a role in poor health outcomes, where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have higher rates of PPHs, as do people living in the most socio-economically disadvantaged areas [@aihw2019]. The evidence base on the health needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with experience of OOHC is increasing, with a mixture of studies using small-scale data from individual clinics to population-wide data based on data linkages. A small number of these studies examine data from Western Australia and tend to either examine health through the lens of increasing risk of contact with CPS or examine data for all children, not just Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children separately.

Given this, there is a clearly identified gap in the literature on the health needs of Western Australian Aboriginal children in OOHC. Further to this, there is also a need to provide a more contemporary, detailed examination of child protection contacts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in WA, as most reporting only includes high-level statistics and WA-specific research had most recently examined data up to 2013 at the time of beginning my PhD research.
